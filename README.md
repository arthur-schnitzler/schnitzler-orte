# schnitzler-orte

Austrian writer Arthur Schnitzler (1862-1931) kept a diary for most of his life, including where he was staying and what excursions he took. He himself had an excerpt of his travels made from it, which today lies as a typescript with 67 pages in his estate in the Cambridge University Library (folder A175). These data were taken as a starting point to achieve a complete listing of his whereabouts. With the help of the diary, individual corrections were made and the missing years 1928 - 1931 were added. 

The result is the XML file in ../editions
